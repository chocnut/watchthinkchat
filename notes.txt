leader_id = MissionHub::Label.all.detect{ |l| l.name == "Leader" }.id
ol = MissionHub::OrganizationalLabel.create :person_id => 2856753, :label_id => leader_id, :added_by_id => 778531

But when I go to http://www.missionhub.com/profile/2856753 I see no labels assigned still

curl -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"organizational_label":{"label_id":"3","person_id":"2856753"}}'  "https://www.missionhub.com/apis/v3/surveys?secret=d871b9810c99bfacca73c2aef946bb0223dcb2d2003eb2440211c0ff312f94d0"

ol = MissionHub::OrganizationalLabel.create "organizational_label" => { :person_id => 2856753, :label_id => leader_id, :added_by_id => 778531 }

Ok, seems you need to include another param in the create hash parllel to organizational_lable, otherwise rails for some reason just behaves as if you passed the inner attributes hash
