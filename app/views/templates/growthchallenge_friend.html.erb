        <p>You are here because a friend of yours, <strong>{{friendsName || friendsEmail}}</strong>, thought you would be able to talk with them and help
          them grow closer to Jesus Christ.<br>
          A spiritual mentor is like a coach. In Matthew 28, Jesus tells us to "go and make disciples." This simply
          means helping others learn to follow Jesus. This is a chance for you to do that with someone you already know!
