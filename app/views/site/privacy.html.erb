Registering on the Site.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>We give visitors to certain Sites the opportunity to register or provide their contact information such as their e-mail address so they can receive updates such as news reports, project or organization reports, opportunities for personal and financial involvement and promotional information.&nbsp; You may also be required to register on the Site to engage in other activities, such as purchases or downloads of materials, services, products, donations, receiving promotions, registering for conferences or activities, or registering for chat rooms or public forums.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information that you provide in these registrations is used consistently with this policy and we will notify you at a particular site if any uses are different than these uses.&nbsp; You can choose not to receive such mailings, or cancel any registrations, by un-subscribing.&nbsp; (See "Opt-In/Opt-Out Communications" below).</p>  <p><strong>4.&nbsp;Security.</strong></p>  <p>For Sites that collect information, we typically employ security measures, including technical, administrative, and physical security steps to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.&nbsp; For example, the Site may use a Secured Socket Layer (SSL) server for activities such as order forms, and for users to make donations, download information and materials, and to make purchases online.&nbsp; For this, users need to provide contact information (such as name, postal and e-mail addresses) and financial information (credit card numbers and expiration dates).&nbsp; Information that is collected from a person may be used to verify their qualifications for registration, to bill them for products and services, and for all purposes related to the transaction.&nbsp; These uses could include processing your order, transmitting information to the participating merchant or service provider, and authenticating your purchase(s), and the information you have provided.&nbsp; We also use technology to protect your credit card number when we store your order and whenever we transfer that information to participating merchants or service providers.</p>  <p>We cannot guarantee that the security measures we implement in connection with the operation of the Site will absolutely prevent others from accessing or acquiring any information that you provide while using the Site.&nbsp; You can do some things to help protect the security of your information.&nbsp; For instance, never give out your password since this is what is used to access all of your account information.&nbsp; Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish visiting our Site, so that other people using the same computer will not have access to your information.</p>  <p><strong>5. &nbsp;Public Forums.</strong></p>  <p>Certain of our Sites may make Forums (as defined in the <a target="" href="/about/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> ) available to its registered users.&nbsp; We might operate these Forums or they may be operated by outside groups.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the content posted in any chat rooms or other Forum.&nbsp; Please remember that any information disclosed in any Forum becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.&nbsp; Also, any information you submit to our Sites is the property of our Sites unless the Site indicates otherwise.&nbsp; If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public (in any Forum, message board, or "chat" environment), you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>  <p><strong>6.&nbsp;Cookies and Information Collected by Technology.</strong></p>  <p>The Site may use cookies to keep track of Web site activities, save your password or deliver content specific to your interests.&nbsp; A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them.&nbsp; A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited.&nbsp; The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself.&nbsp; You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.&nbsp; Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.&nbsp; If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience certain interactive features of the Site or access all of the services provided through the Site.
